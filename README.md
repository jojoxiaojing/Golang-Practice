*How do we run the code:

(1) go run main.go 
    run the main directly
(2) go build main.go 
    make the file into main and run ./main

*What does 'package main' mean?

(1) Package == Project == Workspace
(2) Types of packages: (a) Executable: generates a file that we can run and (b)reusable: helpers, put reusable logic
(3) package main -> go build -> produce main
